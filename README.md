## Introduction - What it is?

Illusionna is a powerful utility desktop app allowing to interact with GitHub repositories through GitHub API to create Pull Requests by simply importing content and operating on
it (replacing, refactoring, deleting...). It is a very useful tool for people not used GitHub stuff and even Git stuff.

## Why?

GitHub and Git concepts are not very easy to understand to people that are not used to development. If you are an artist not doing any development stuff, you will ask: what is a
Pull Request? What is a Branch? What is a Fork? Why do I need to bother me to manage all of that for just proposing new files directly to the source?

While all that stuff is required for good project versionning and management, it is indeed very not handy for these kind of people. This is why we initially made Illusionna: to
propose a tool allowing artists to simply, progressively upload their work and provide it directly to the project repository, removing all the non-interesting steps and concepts
that artists should not have to deal with.

## Will it improve with time?

Yes. The app is open to enhancement proposals and contributions so feel free to talk to what you would like to have inside it.
